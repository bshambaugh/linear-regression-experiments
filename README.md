These are linear regression experiments to learn machine learning.

I am following Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course:

To understand the material for exercise 3, I found other resources talking about Linear Regression with Gradient Descent.  

For the basic elementary thinking, I liked Daniel Shiffman's steering example borrowed from Craig Reynold's 
Steering Behaviours (http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/).

The videos in the range 3.2 - 3.4 at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bCN8LKrcMa6zF4FPtXyXYj give Shiffman's presentation.

This optimization works for problems that do not present themselves as functions, thus do have not analytical solution. (Thank you Waylon Flinn) It does not appear to be optimization like in RW Hamming's book, "Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers", because we cannot find a derivative?
